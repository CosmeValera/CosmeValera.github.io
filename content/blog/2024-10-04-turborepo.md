<h4><b>🧐 Why Turborepo?</b></h4>

Managing multiple microfrontends within a monorepo can be challenging. Turborepo offers a powerful solution to optimize workflows, run tasks in parallel, and cache results for faster builds.

<b>Parallel Tasks:</b> Run builds and tests across multiple microfrontends simultaneously.

<b>Intelligent Caching:</b> Save time by reusing outputs from previous runs.

<b>Scalable:</b> Manage as many microfrontends as needed, all within a single monorepo.
If you're working with multiple apps, Turborepo is a game-changer for streamlining your workflows.

Here's how you can set up and use Turborepo in your project:

---

<h4><b>🔧 1. Creating a Turborepo Project</b></h4>

<b>1.1 Create a New Turborepo Project:</b> 

Instead of manually setting up Turborepo, you can use the following command to quickly scaffold a new Turborepo:

```sh
npx create-turbo@latest
```

<b>1.2 Place your microfrontends inside the `apps` directory:</b> 

```sh
apps/
 ├── mfe1/
 ├── mfe2/
 └── mfe3/
package.json
turbo.json
```
<h4><b>📄 2. Important Configuration Files</b></h4>

`package.json` defines your scripts, dependencies, and workspace structure

`turbo.json` configures how tasks are run across your monorepo. It also includes caching settings to speed up subsequent runs.

<h4><b>⚡ 3. Running Turborepo Commands</b></h4>
After setting up Turborepo, you can easily manage all apps and packages with a few simple commands:

<b>Install dependencies:</b>
```sh
npm i 
```

<b>Build all apps and packages:</b>
```sh
npm run build 
```

<b>Start the development environment:</b>
```sh
npm run dev 
```

> Run any of these commands twice, and Turborepo will use its smart caching to speed up subsequent builds.
