<h4><b>ü§î Overview</b></h4>

In large-scale projects maintaining consistent styles across multiple applications is crucial. Here are two key approaches for managing shared styles:

1. üì¶ Creating a shared styles library as a <b>npm package</b>.
2. üîó Directly importing styles from <b>a centralized directory</b> within the monorepo.

---

<h4><b>üì¶ 1. Creating a Styles Library with npm</b></h4>

<b>Overview:</b> This approach involves creating a dedicated styles library that is published as a npm package. The styles can then be imported into any project that needs them.

<b>Implementation:</b> For example, if you're working with custom theme styles for PrimeReact, you can create your styles in a library and export them using an `index.js` file like this:

<div class="code-block">
module.exports = {
    theme: require('./style/themes/my-theme/theme.scss'),
};
</div>

After publishing the package, you can install it in your projects using:
<div class="code-block">
npm i my-theme
</div>

Then, simply import the styles in your main JavaScript entry point:
<div class="code-block">
import 'my-theme';
</div>

<b>Pros:</b>
Centralized version control of styles.
Easy to update and distribute across multiple projects.

<b>Cons:</b>
Requires publishing and versioning with each change.

<h4><b>üîó 2. Direct Import from a Centralized Directory</b></h4>

<b>Overview:</b> If you‚Äôre using a monorepo setup, you can store your styles in a central directory and import them directly into each project.

<b>Implementation:</b> Place your styles in a folder at the root level, parallel to your apps, and import them in your projects:

<div class="code-block">
import '../style/themes/my-theme/theme.scss';
</div>

<b>Pros:</b>
No need to publish or manage versions.
Immediate access to the latest styles without additional steps.

<b>Cons:</b>
Potential for accidental breaking changes if styles are updated.
Need to have a monorepo structure; doesn't work if the projects are split into different repositories.

<h4><b>‚ùì What to choose</b></h4>

- Use a <b>npm package</b> if you want to have strict version control or you don't have all your projects in the same folder.
- Use direct importing from <b>a centralized directory</b> if you prefer a simpler solution and your code structure allows it.
